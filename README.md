Challenge 15

Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
  1. visualize an earthquake dataset by visiting the USGS GeoJSON. 
  2. Import and visualize the data by Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset     
     based on their longitude and latitude.
  3. Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by      color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear       darker in color. 
  4. Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked. 
  5. Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
